** Unider Development **

This is a SuperCollider plugin of the High Order Ambsionics (HOA) Library.
It's still in early development stage.

To compile, choose a path and then execute
``git clone --recursive``
``cd HoaLibrary-SuperCollider``
``mkdir build``
``cd build``
``cmake -DSC_PATH=path_to_sc_repository -DSC_PLUGINS_PATH=path_to_sc_plugins ..``
``make install``

SC\_PLUGINS\_PATH/HoaLibrary is the folder where the files will be installed

This version is not yet complete, notably there are still no help files.
