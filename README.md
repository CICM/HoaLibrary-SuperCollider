** Unider Development **

This is a SuperCollider plugin of the High Order Ambsionics (HOA) Library.
It's still in early development stage.
To compile, change the SuperCollider and HoaLibrary-Light folders in cmake, go to build directory and then run ``cmake ..``
There's a script which copies the generated files to the correct SuperCollider folder called copy_script.sh, however, it uses my absolute path, so I don't recommend using it.
